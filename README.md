### Version info

This app was originally generated on Tue Nov 27 2018 17:00:36 GMT+0530 (IST) using Sails v1.1.0.

<!-- Internally, Sails used [`sails-generate@1.16.0`](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-generate/tree/v1.16.0/lib/core-generators/new). -->

<!--
Note:  Generators are usually run using the globally-installed `sails` CLI (command-line interface).  This CLI version is _environment-specific_ rather than app-specific, thus over time, as a project's dependencies are upgraded or the project is worked on by different developers on different computers using different versions of Node.js, the Sails dependency in its package.json file may differ from the globally-installed Sails CLI release it was originally generated with.  (Be sure to always check out the relevant [upgrading guides](https://sailsjs.com/upgrading) before upgrading the version of Sails used by your app.  If you're stuck, [get help here](https://sailsjs.com/support).)

### Database

_AWS Aurora PostgreSQL_ ‚Äì selected for performance, observability & monitoring tools, and granular rollback features.

### API

##### Application Framework

- [`Sails`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sails) : Selected for maturity, popularity, developer experience, built-in policies and and an extensive ecosystem that includes a large variety of ORM adapters.

- [`Sails PostgreSQL`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sails-postgresql) : Official Sails PostgreSQL ORM adapter.

- [`AWS SDK`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk) : For interacting with Comprehend.

- [`Request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) : Request is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http calls. It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default. It is used to interact with the 3rd party services like Auth0 and Diffbot.

- [`Metascraper`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metascraper): A library to easily scrape metadata from an article on the web using Open Graph metadata, regular HTML metadata, and series of fallbacks. Mainly it is used to extract publisher information using `metascraper-publisher`.

- [`uuid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) : Simple, fast generation of RFC4122 UUIDS. It is used to generate unique string indexes.

##### Developement Tools

- [`mocha`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) : Simple, flexible, fun JavaScript test framework for Node.js & The Browser.

- [`Prettier`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) : Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules.

- [`husky`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) : Husky can prevent bad git commit, git push and more üê∂ woof!

#### DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:

Directory structure is maintained according `sails` guidlines with minor changes:

- `Scraper`: module is added in the root directory whose responsibilities is to retrieve metadata from different scrapers. It contains mainly 3 scrapers:

&emsp; 1. _MetaScraper_ - used to get publisher information.

&emsp; 2. _Diffbot_ - used to get various metadata like `whole text body`, `tags`, `language`, `title` etc.

&emsp; 3. _Comprehend_ - used to get named entities or we say relevant terms from article text using aws comprehend.

Diffbot and Metascraper are run in parallel to get different information and text from the metadata is given to comprehend to get relevnt terms and then returned to the desired module.

- `Consumers`: Apart from scrapers any communication with third party service is responsibility of the consumer module.

_A brief directory structure is as follows:_

`/api` - Container of sails controllers, models, helpers etc

&emsp;`/controllers` - actions that are linked with end points (All actions are created using sails [`action2`](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/actions-and-controllers) structure)

&emsp;&emsp; `/Article` - contain all actions related to articles

&emsp;&emsp; `/Auth` - contain actions related to sign-in,sign-up, google sign-in.

&emsp;&emsp; `/SwaggerController.js` - contain boilerplate code to create swagger compatible json.

&emsp; `/helpers` - contain [sails helpers](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/helpers)

&emsp; `/models` - contain sails [models](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/models). Different [models](#models) are already defined above.

&emsp; `/policies` - contain sails [policies](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/policies).

`/config` - contain sails [config](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/configuration).

`/consumers` - all 3rd party services to be consumed apart from `scraper` will be contained by this.

&emsp; `/auth0.js` - contains Auth0 api's consumers

`/scraper` - contains different scrapers.

&emsp; `/comprehend.js` - comprehend scraper.

&emsp; `/diffbot.js` - diffbot scraper.

&emsp; `/metascraper.js` - metascraper.

&emsp; `/index.js` - execute all scrapers and provide results to desired modules.

`/test` - container for all test cases.

&emsp; `/scraper` - contain test cases for scraper module.

`/app.js` - reponsible for bootstrapping the whole application and server.

### Routes

- **GET /articles (Timeline)** : Reponsible for providing timeline of relevant articles for the current article.

_Arguments (query)_:
`{ url - current tab URL to get timeline for}`

_Responses_:
`200 - articles:[], terms: { type: TermType, text: string }[]`

_Imlementation Flow_:
The end point implementation flow can be broken down to following points:

- Get url of the article from query and check if it exists in db or not.

- If it exists then metadata (extracted from article earlier) is already present in the database so retrieve this information from database.

- If it does not exist then use [`scraper`](#scraper) module to get metadata of article.

- Extract terms from the metadata and do a terms-terms matching, if one or more articles if found then return articles along with the terms retrieved from the page.

- If none of the articles are present then do a full-text of article's content (body) with the named entities(terms) and return the result.
